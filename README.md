## Overview

In this project, I implemented three web pages using Bootstrap. I applied HTML, CSS, Accessibility, Responsive Design, and Bootstrap to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages that align with a given design file.

## Requirements

-   **Bootstrap Usage**: Utilized the Bootstrap framework for the majority of the styling and layout.
-   **Minimal Custom CSS**: Kept the  `styles.css`  file as small as possible by leveraging Bootstrap classes extensively.
-   **Design Fidelity**: Ensured that the web pages looked the same as the provided designer file.
